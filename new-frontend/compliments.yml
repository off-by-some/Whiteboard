- "A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets bitten by a poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for help, then go about ten feet and pretend that *you* got bit by a snake. Then start an argument with him about who's going to go get help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why it makes you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke."
- "A good way to threaten somebody is to light a stick of dynamite. Then you call the guy and hold the burning fuse up to the phone. \"Hear that?\" you say. \"That's dynamite, baby.\""

- "As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was, and how I named him Flint."
- "As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red again, I sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a bunch of honking and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way."
- "As we were driving, we saw a sign that said \"Watch for Rocks.\" Marta said it should read \"Watch for Pretty Rocks.\" I told her she should write in her suggestion to the highway department, but she started saying it was a joke - just to get out of writing a simple letter! And I thought I was lazy!"
- "At first I thought, if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity would be \"Clark Kent, Dentist,\" because you could save money on tooth X-rays. But then I thought, if a patient said, \"How's my back tooth?\" and you just looked at it with your X-ray vision and said, \"Oh it's okay,\" then the patient would probably say, \"Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?\" and you'd say, \"Aw fuck you, get outta here,\" and then he probably wouldn't even pay his bill."
- "Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks his head out when you're coming home his face might burn up."
- "Broken promises don't upset me. I just think, why did they believe me?"

- "Consider the daffodil. And while you're doing that, I'll be over here, looking through your stuff."
- "Contrary to what most people say, the most dangerous animal in the world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant. It's a shark riding on an elephant's back, just trampling and eating everything they see."
- "Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis."
- "Don't ever get your speedometer confused with your clock, like I did once, because the faster you go the later you think you are."
- "During the Middle Ages, probably one of the biggest mistakes was not putting on your armor because you were \"just going down to the corner.\""
- "Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me quite a bit of freedom. I could walk freely, make my own meals, and even hurl large rocks at their heads. It was only later that I discovered that they were not Indians at all but only dirty-clothes hampers."
- "Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaught on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, \"Think again, bat man.\""
- "For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: why not add a slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness?"
- "He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, \"Dust to dust,\" some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, \"I'll be waiting for you in heaven--with a gun.\""
- "Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't know anybody: First take out the garbage. Then go around and collect any extra garbage that people might have, like a crumpled napkin, and take that out too. Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy garbage guy."
- "I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex."
- "I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, \"If I have come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky.\" Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh."
- "I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in every culture, is the story of Popeye."
- "I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the crash stuff, then, when somebody comes up, act like they just woke up and go, \"What was THAT?!\""
- "I bet when the neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone would always end up saying, \"Don't forget the thick, heavy brows.\" Then they would all get embarrassed because they remembered they had the big hunky brows too, and they'd get mad and eat the snowman."
- "I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it."
- "I can still recall old Mister Barnslow getting out every morning and nailing a fresh load of tadpoles to the old board of his. Then he'd spin it round and round, like a wheel of fortune, and no matter where it stopped he'd yell out, \"Tadpoles! Tadpoles is a winner!\" We all thought he was crazy. But then we had some growing up to do."

- "I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd like to see more and more planets fall under the ruthless domination of our solar system."
- "I guess I kinda lost control, because in the middle of the play I ran up and lit the evil puppet villain on fire. No, I didn't. Just kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the human emotions, which is freaking out. Another emotion is greed, as when you kill someone for money, or something like that. Another emotion is generosity, as when you pay someone double what he paid for his stupid puppet."
- "I guess the hard thing for a lot of people to accept is why God would allow me to go running through their yards, yelling and spinning around."
- "I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that said, \"I helped skin Bob.\""
- "I hate it when people say somebody has a \"speech impediment\", even if he does, because it could hurt his feelings. So instead, I call it a \"speech improvement\", and I go up to the guy and say, \"Hey, Bob, I like your speech improvement.\" I think this makes him feel better."
- "I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king, they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with some good ideas."

- "I love to go to the schoolyard and watch the children jump and scream, but they don't know I'm using blanks."
- "I remember how my great-uncle Jerry would sit on the porch and whittle all day long. Once he whittled me a toy boat out of a larger toy boat I had. It was almost as good as the first one, except now it had bumpy whittle marks all over it. And no paint, because he had whittled off the paint."
- "I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. \"You don't have to tell me,\" I said. \"I'm off the team, aren't I?\" \"Well,\" said Coach, \"you never were really ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times.\" It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I felt the handcuffs go on."
- "I scrambled to the top of the precipice where Nick was waiting. \"That was fun,\" I said. \"You bet it was,\" said Nick. \"Let's climb higher.\" \"No,\" I said. \"I think we should be heading back now.\" \"We have time,\" Nick insisted. I said we didn't, and Nick said we did. We argued back and forth like that for about 20 minutes, then finally decided to head back. I didn't say it was an interesting story."
- "I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate revolver. and since he is so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him real quick and give it to him."
- "I think a good product would be \"Baby Duck Hat.\" It's a fake baby duck, which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. Then all of the sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla. Man those ducks really take off! Also Baby Duck Hat is good for parties."
- "I think a pillow should be the peace symbol, not the dove. The pillow has more feathers than the dove, and it doesn't have a beak to peck you with."
- "I think college administrators should encourage students to urinate on walls and bushes, because then when students from another college come sniffing around, they'll know this is someone else's territory."
- "I think my new thing will be to try to be a real happy guy. I'll just walk around being real happy until some jerk says something stupid to me."
- "I think one way the cops could make money would be to hold a murder weapons sale. Many people could really use used ice picks."
- "I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the luncheon was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in his hand, pretending he's throwing up, is not what I call hospitality."
- "I think the mistake a lot of us make is thinking the state-appointed shrink is our friend."
- "I wish a robot would get elected president. That way, when he came to town, we could all take a shot at him and not feel too bad."
- "I wish I had a dollar for every time I spent a dollar, because then, Yahoo!, I'd have all my money back."
- "I wish I had a Kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both Dracula AND Superman away."
- "I wish I lived back in the old west days, because I'd save up my money for about twenty years so I could buy a solid-gold pick. Then I'd go out West and start digging for gold. When someone came up and asked what I was doing, I'd say, \"Looking for gold, ya durn fool.\" He'd say, \"Your pick is gold,\" and I'd say, \"Well, that was easy.\" Good joke, huh."

- "I wish outer space guys would conquer the Earth and make people their pets, because I'd like to have one of those little beds with my name on it. "
- "I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fishermen caught a big shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person. Then they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark. And in the baby shark there isn't a person, because it would be too small. But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy---something like that."
- "I'd like to be buried Indian-style, where they put you up on a high rack, above the ground. That way, you could get hit by meteorites and not even feel it."
- "I'd like to see a nature film where an eagle swoops down and pulls a fish out of a lake, and then maybe he's flying along, low to the ground, and the fish pulls a worm out of the ground. Now that's a documentary."
- "I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those high notes, I bet you can really see it in those genitals."
- "I'd rather be rich than stupid."

- "If I could be a bird, I'd be a Flying Purple People Eater because then people would sing about me and I could fly down and eat them because I hate that song."
- "If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people, like I am now."
- "If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call it Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for tramps, which is not the impression we are trying to convey with our store. On the other hand, we would not prohibit tramps from browsing, or testing the trampolines, unless a tramp's gyrations seemed to be getting out of control."
- "If I lived back in the wild west days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if some smart-aleck cowboy said something like \"Hey, look. He's carrying a soldering iron!\" and started laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say, \"That's right, it's a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice.\" Then everybody would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of the soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free drink."
- "If I was the head of a country that lost a war, and I had to sign a peace treaty, just as I was signing, I'd glance over the treaty and then suddenly act surprised. \"Wait a minute! I thought we won!\""
- "If life deals you lemons, why not go kill someone with the lemons (maybe by shoving them down his throat)."
- "If they ever come up with a swashbuckling school, I think one of the courses should be laughing, then jumping off something."
- "If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason."
- "If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes, Mr. Brave man, I guess I'm a coward."
- "If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid looking in a mirror, because I bet that will really throw you into a panic."
- "If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the mirror, because I bet that's what REALLY throws you into a panic."
- "If you ever crawl inside an old hollow log and go to sleep, and while you're in there some guys come and seal up both ends and then put it on a truck and take it to another city, boy, I don't know what to tell you."
- "If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let'em go, because, man, they're gone."
- "If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy."
- "If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer, I bet you could shoot beer out of you nose."
- "If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build to that."
- "If you get invited to your first orgy, don't just show up nude. That's a common mistake. You have to let nudity \"happen.\""
- "If you go flying back through time and you see somebody else flying forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact."
- "If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and you friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to pretend you were swimming."
- "If you go to a costume party at your boss's house, wouldn't you think a good costume would be to dress up like the boss's wife? Trust me, it's not."

- "If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong, though. It's Hambone."
- "If you want to be the most popular person in your class, whenever the professor pauses in his lecture, just let out a big snort and say \"How do you figger that!\" real loud. Then lean back and sort of smirk."

- "If you work on a lobster boat, sneaking up behind people and pinching them is probably a joke that gets old real fast."

- "If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then gets right back on you, I think you should buck him off right away."
- "If you're a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing or the cranberry sauce or anything else, just pretend like you're eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a big mushy ball. Then, later, when you're out back having cigars with the boys, let out a big fake cough and throw the ball to the ground. Then say, \"Boy, these are good cigars!\""
- "If you're a young Mafia gangster out on your first date, I bet it's real embarrassing if someone tries to kill you."

- "If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, I think it's okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the vultures, to teach him to do some tricks. But only if you're serious about adopting the vulture."
- "Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like a regular window."
- "Instead of having \"answers\" on a math test, they should just call them \"impressions,\" and if you got a different \"impression,\" so what, can't we all be brothers?"
- "Instead of mousetraps, what about baby traps? Not to harm the babies, but just to hold them down until they can be removed?"

- "Laurie got offended that I used the word \"puke.\" But to me, that's what her dinner tasted like."
- "Life, to me, is like a quiet forest pool, one that needs a direct hit from a big rock half-buried in the ground. You pull and you pull, but you can't get the rock out of the ground. So you give it a good kick, but you lose your balance and go skidding down the hill toward the pool. Then out comes a big Hawaiian man who was screwing his wife beside the pool because they thought it was real pretty. He tells you to get out of there, but you start faking it, like you're talking Hawaiian, and then he gets mad and chases you..."

- "Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it \"dull\" that Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead by an ant, and at first it didn't seem like anything, but then the bite got worse and worse, so he went to a doctor in town, and the secretary told him to wait, so he sat down and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and then finally he got to see the doctor, and the doctor put some salve on it? You call that dull?"

- "Once when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a mysterious old stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted to tell someone about the treasure. I said, \"Okay, as long as it's not a long story. Some of us have a plane to catch, you know.\" He stared telling hes story, about the treasure and his life and all, and I thought: \"This story isn't too long.\" But then, he kept going, and I started thinking, \"Uh-oh, this story is getting long.\" But then the story was over, and I said to myself: \"You know, that story wasn't too long after all.\" I forget what the story was about, but there was a good movie on the plane.

For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to DisneyLand, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. \"Oh, no,\" I said, \"DisneyLand burned down.\" He cried and cried, but I think that deep down he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real DisneyLand, but it was getting pretty late."

- "Sometimes life seems like a dream, especially when I look down and see that I forgot to put on my pants."

When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but you know what I've left on the porch? A jack-o-lantern with a knife stuck in the side of it's head with a note that says \"You.\" After that I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done."
- "Sometimes you have to be careful when selecting a new name for yourself. For instance, let's say you have chosen the nickname \"Fly Head.\" Normally you would think that \"fly Head\" would mean a person who has beautiful swept-back features, as if flying through the air. But think again. Couldn't it also mean \"having a head like a fly\"? I'm afraid some people might actually think that."
- "Sometimes, when I drive across the desert in the middle of the night, with no other cars around, I start imagining: What if there were no civilization out there? No cities, no factories, no people? And then I think: No people or factories? Then who made this car? And this highway? And I get so confused I have to stick my head out the window into the driving rain---unless there's lightning, because I could get struck on the head by a bolt."
- "The crows seemed to be calling his name, thought Caw."
- "The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the face."
- "The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength to me. I remember we'd all pile into the car - I forget what kind it was - and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger, older guy we called \"Dad.\" We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things never leave you."
- "The next time I have meat and mashed potatoes, I think I'll put a very large blob of potatoes on my plate with just a little piece of meat. And if someone asks me why I didn't get more meat, I'll just say, \"Oh, you mean this?\" and pull out a big piece of meat from inside the blob of potatoes, where I've hidden it. Good magic trick, huh?"
- "The people in the village were real poor, so none of the children had any toys. But this one little boy had gotten an old enema bag and filled it with rocks, and he would go around and whap the other children across the face with it. Man, I think my heart almost broke. Later the boy came up and offered to give me the toy. This was too much! I reached out my hand, but then he ran away. I chased him down and took the enema bag. He cried a little, but that's the way of these people."
- "The tired and thirsty prospector threw himself down at the edge of the watering hole and started to drink. But then he looked around and saw skulls and bones everywhere. \"Uh-oh,\" he thought. \"This watering hole is reserved for skeletons.\""
- "The whole town laughed at my great-grandfather, just because he worked hard and saved his money. True, working at the hardware store didn't pay much, but he felt it was better than what everybody else did, which was go up to the volcano and collect the gold nuggets it shot out every day. It turned out he was right. After forty years, the volcano petered out. Everybody left town, and the hardware store went broke. Finally he decided to collect gold nuggets too, but there weren't many left by then. Plus, he broke his leg and the doctor's bills were real high."
- "To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other."

- "Too bad when I was a kid there wasn't a guy in our class that everybody called the \"Cricket Boy\", because I would have liked to stand up in class and tell everybody, \"You can make fun of the Cricket Boy if you want to, but to me he's just like everybody else.\" Then everybody would leave the Cricket Boy alone, and I'd invite him over to spend the night at my house, but after about five minutes of that loud chirping I'd have to kick him out. Maybe later we could get up a petition to get the Cricket Family run out of town. Bye, Cricket Boy."
- "Too bad you can't buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the earth spin real fast and freak everybody out."
- "We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can't scoff at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys me."
- "We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off and go fishing. But we wouldn't be laughing that evening when he'd come back with some whore he picked up in town."
- "What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds singing and the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want to get drunk? And after you're real drunk, maybe go down to the public park and stagger around and ask people for money, and then lay down and go to sleep."
